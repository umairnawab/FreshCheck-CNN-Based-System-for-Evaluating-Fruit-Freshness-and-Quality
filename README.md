# FreshCheck: CNN-Based System for Evaluating Fruit Freshness and Quality

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
FreshCheck is a deep learning-based system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fruit freshness and quality. The model will analyze fruit images to determine their condition based on visual cues such as color, texture, and surface damage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Question
How can Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) be utilized to classify fruits as good or bad for consumption based on visual cues such as color, texture, and surface damage?

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
